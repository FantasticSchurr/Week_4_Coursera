## Divisions of data science questions:

2. Explanatory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

### Descriptive Analysis

To *describe* or *summarize* data. Usually the first kind of analysis you perform. Generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements. 

* Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)

* Measures of variability (range, standard deviations, variance)

There is no inference about what the distribution of data means or predictions on how the data might trend in the future. It is just to show you a summary of the data you collected. 

#### Calls in R for doing these tasks are:

`mean()` or `median()` or `mode()`. 

You may also call `summary()`
